During the last decade, hateful and sexist content towards women is being increasingly spread on social networks. Exposure to sexist speech has serious consequences for womenâ€™s life and limits their freedom of speech. Previous studies have focused on identifying hatred or violence towards women. However, sexism is expressed in very different forms: it includes subtle stereotypes and attitudes that, although frequently unnoticed, are extremely harmful to both women and society. In this work, we experiment with a new task that aims to understand and analyze how sexism, from explicit hate or violence to subtle expressions, is expressed in online
conversations.
