The automatic processing of images to extract semantic content is a task that has gained a lot of importance in recent years due to the constantly increasing number of digital photos on the internet. Organizing the images in an intelligent way using indexing and image retrieval techniques requires effective and efficient image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms that are capable of extracting relevant semantic information. Face recognition finds its crucial application in many real-life applications such as AI-driven surveillance systems, access control interactions, immigration, education, retail, etc. Machine learning has been successfully incorporated into all these sectors. But the gray area lies in the fact that the applications can be computationally expensive and may be difficult to implement when little data is available. In this paper, we are exploring a method for facial verification
using a Siamese neural network. It deploys a neural network to classify the similarity between two input faces.
Previous papers were able to employ the Siamese neural network for character recognition efficiently. This paper
will try to extend the work toward facial recognition systems. Once we tune the network, the network becomes
capable of predicting new data as well as new classes from unknown distributions. To exceed the predicting
powers of previously formulated techniques, this paper will be used convolutional neural networks.
