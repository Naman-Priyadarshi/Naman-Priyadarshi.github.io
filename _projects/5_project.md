Following data collection, preprocessing and feature engineering were conducted to prepare the data for sentiment analysis. Utilizing Roberta sentiment analysis model, the tweets were classified into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments. The project culminated in the computation of an overall happiness index for each Indian state based on the sentiment values derived. This study contributes to understanding the sentiments and experiences of Indian students on social media platforms, potentially aiding in policy formulation and academic support initiatives.
